        <h1>Bus Mall Survey</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Please take our short survey on new possible products that could become available to you soon! Here we have given you three separte images that you can choose from. Click on the one that interests you the most, something that you could see yourself using in your own home! As you make your selection from the three images a new set of images will appear that you will then be able to choose from again. You will be given 25 votes on the items that you are interested in the most. Once you are done voting a chart will appear to let you know what your results of the survey are. We appreciate your participation in our study, thank you! </p>
